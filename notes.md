It is a capital mistake to hypothesize without data

Some people (mostly on Twitter) initially claimed that 300,000 people had been turned away at the polls.  However, our friends at [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/300000-wisconsin-voters-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-laws/) followed the purported sources, and found them lacking.  This number also doesn't pass the smell test.  We can see that Dem vote totals went down by 240,000 from 2012 to 2016.

{{<localplotly "WI/multiyear.html" 825 425>}}

In order for the 300,000 number to be right, _all_ of those people would have to have been turned away at the polls, _and_ 60,000 new voters would have needed to show up and be turned away.  This is unlikely.
