<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>To understand what made 2016 different from 2012, we can just subtract.</p>

<p>We can approximate the Trump effect as the difference between the 2016 Republicans Presidential vote percentage and the 2012 percentage to see where Trump outperformed Romney (and won while Romney lost).</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>For example, in Winnebago, Wisconsin, Romney got 47% of the vote and Trump got 50.5%. This is a +3% Republican shift that flipped the county from blue to red.</p>

<p>In the map above, we clearly see that Trump underperformed Romney in Utah and parts of Idaho.  (This makes sense, since Evan McMullin was a spoiler candidate and Mormons abandoned Trump in droves.)  However, Trump overperformed in Missouri, Iowa, Ohio, and generally in the Great Lakes region.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>This leads to the obvious questions: Why these regions?  What was the basis of Trump&rsquo;s appeal?</p>

<p>Some local effects immediately jump out.  For example, that big blue blotch in Utah and Idaho (where the R candidate dramatically underperformed in 2016 compared to 2012) is Mormon country.  Romney, a Mormon, enjoyed much higher support than Trump, who struggled for support given his behavior.  Additionally, Ed McMullin (a Mormon) ran as a third party spoiler candidate, achieving his greatest support in his home state of Utah.</p>
