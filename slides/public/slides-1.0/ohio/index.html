<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Ohio.</p>

<p>The outliers of Ohio are mostly concentrated in the east and southeast parts of the state.</p>

<p>What is notable about that part of the state?  That is where the coal seams are, and where coal mining has historically happened.</p>

<p><img src="https://bwarren2.github.io/voting_2016/ohio/ohiocoal_map.png" width="600" height="600" /></p>

<p>An initial guess might be that coal miners had exceptionally negative views of Hillary Clinton, and/or positive views of Donald Trump.  Why might that be?</p>

<p>This clip makes a &ldquo;miners dislike Clinton&rdquo; intuition a little more substantial, trending toward plausible.  I think the attack ad you make out of this clip if you run the Trump campaign in Ohio is pretty obvious.</p>

<p>But even if a county doesn&rsquo;t <em>produce</em> coal, it might be invested in coal.  What is something you can build near coal mines to make money?  Coal-fired power plants.  For example, in Gallia (at the southern tip of that map):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of Gallia County&rsquo;s largest employers are the Lightstone Generation Power Plant and OVEC Kyger Creek Power Plant.  The Lightstone Generation, Gavin Plant is a 2.6 Gigawatt coal-fired power station in Cheshire, OH.  It is the largest coal fired power facility in Ohio, and one of the largest in the nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, coal plants or retirements afflict much of the area with a big percentage shift toward Trump.</p>

<p>Whether your county&rsquo;s coal plant is retiring or not, a hostility toward coal represents a threat to a source of lucrative jobs in your community.  There is another piece, though: insofar as Clinton was favorable to Obama policies, the Obama administration&rsquo;s Clean Air rule (which increased regulatory burden on coal plants) can also be read as hostile or deleterious to those sources of jobs.  In fact, in anecdotal interviews with miners, that was exactly what came up.</p>

<p>In addition to digging coal out of the ground and burning it immediately for power, what else might you do with it?  Sell it and ship it elsewhere.  That would probably be easiest if you carted the coal north, to Cleveland and the Great Lakes, which is historically exactly what happened.  And if you have a confluence of shipping and energy, you might build a bunch of manufacturing there, like energy-intensive steel foundries.</p>

<p>Not only is northeast Ohio the home of steel production, it is the main base of Ohio manufacturing generally.</p>
